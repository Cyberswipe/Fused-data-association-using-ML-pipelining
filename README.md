# Abstract
With the advent of diverse sensor systems and image processing algorithms that allow very accurate analysis of parametric features application based algorithms to integrate features of multiple data systems. Complimentary features used are capable of overcoming physical limitations set by Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) and hyperspectral data. A graph based fusion approach which is able to integrate feature fusion while also accommodating feature reduction as implemented by a variable kernel based component analysis model. Stacked spatial, elevation and spectralfeatures form the weighted edges which improves the
identification accuracy over binary edges. This letter focuses on the improvement in identification accuracy overisolated LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data.
